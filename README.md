### About this project
This project is part of The Odin Project's Flexbox Section completion project, named "Landing Page".
The aim is to re-create a webpage based on the images provided in the /Ref directory.

### Creating a skeleton first
I have created the html skeleton based on the reference image. Check the relevant version of the index.html file.

![html skeleton render](./doc/1.html_skeleton.png)

You will see the address bar has some local ip-address like thing. That's because I'm using a ==VScode extension named Live Server (55M+ downloads)==. When you right click on your index.html file and open it with Live Server, it updates the changes in realtime as you save your edits. No need to refresh the browser. Though I didn't use it much to check my html skeleton because I knew the render is going to flow normally and the containers are going to stack on one another. But this Live Server will be tremendously helpful in applying CSS. Most of my CSS exercises benefitted from having the Live Server and text-editor and browser window side-by-side.
